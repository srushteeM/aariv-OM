I started crying in front of the entire class and was embarrassed to such an extent that I went home and told my mother.

My classmate eventually became open-minded but many people in this world arenâ€™t aware of their actions and words and how much harm they cause to other people hence I have made this quiz to make them understand of their bias on different stereotypical situations like gender, color, cultural, economic and etc;<br><br>* I relocated to the Philippines when I was six years old, and for the next three years of my life there, I attended a public school.<br><br>* My classmates gave me an astonished and disdainful look when I initially started school and went there.
